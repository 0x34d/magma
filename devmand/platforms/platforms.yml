# So this is just a strawman but here is an basic idea what a driver may look
# like. Basically this file contains a few drivers. Each driver has a platform
# key so for instance if a device is loaded with the "MikroTik" platform the
# driver specified under MikroTik will be used. In the case of MikroTik we have
# no specific paths defined as it support standardized config methods. It does
# extend the snmp-oc and snmp-ietf platforms which means it will inherit those
# paths. The snmp-oc and snmp-ietf platforms each defined a few xpaths. The
# xpaths each have a channel that should be used. Note that channels login
# information is defined in the config file for each device which will cause a
# channel to be created for that given device. If a node is hit in the config
# or state in the tree which matches the given xpath the channel will be found
# and given the rest of the data in the object. In the cases below this is the
# method (get_or_set) and the oid. The oid will sometimes use elements found in
# the xpath above such as the if index. Nothing here is set in stone or
# implemented I'm just trying to sketch out what it might look like.
